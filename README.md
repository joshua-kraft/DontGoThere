# DontGoThere

## Purpose

Ever found yourself back at a place that disappointed you, only to realize too late that you’d been there before and had a bad experience? **DontGoThere** is here to ensure you never make the same mistake twice!

With **DontGoThere**, you can easily track places where you’ve had less-than-stellar experiences. The app allows you to document each location with a name, address, review, and photos. Plus, it will send you gentle reminders if you find yourself back in the vicinity of those places.

## Key Features

- **iCloud Sync**: All of your places are synchronized across your devices using iCloud. Add a place with your iPhone in the moment, and edit it later on your iPad or Mac!
  
- **Active and Archived Places**: Only active places send you notifications, so you won’t be bothered about old grievances. When a place no longer needs your attention, it automatically archives itself, keeping your list tidy.
  
- **Automatic Archiving**: Set places to archive themselves after a certain period or after a specific number of reminders. Once archived, places will delete themselves after some time, unless you choose to keep them.
  
- **Smart Notifications**: Receive a reminder when you’re near a place you’ve marked, but only once per day. Customize the notification settings to suit your preferences, including how close you need to be to get alerted.
  
- **Map and List Views**: Browse your list of places or view them on a map with easy-to-spot icons that help you avoid trouble spots.
  
- **Quick Add**: Add places on the fly at your current location or anywhere on the map with just a tap.
  
- **Search and Add**: Find and mark specific places on the map to make sure you never accidentally return.
